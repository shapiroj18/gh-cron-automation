# gh-cron-automation

## Description
This is a set of node scripts to prove out the concept of running basic jobs via GitHub Actions `schedule` events.

## Notes
* From the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule), the shortest interval you can run scheduled workflows is once every 15 minutes

## Running Script Manually
1. `node basic_time/main.js`
